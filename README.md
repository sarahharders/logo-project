The TMS-Speech-Therapy-Effectiveness repository is a collection of code that explores the effectiveness of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment in combination with speech therapy. This research project aims to investigate the potential benefits of utilizing TMS as an adjunct therapy for speech-related disorders.

The repository contains code files that were developed to process and analyze data collected during the research. All data processing was carried out in accordance with established guidelines and protocols to ensure accurate and reliable results. The code provides a framework for organizing and manipulating the data, implementing statistical analyses, and visualizing the findings.

To contribute to the project or inquire further about the research, please reach out to Sarah Harders at sarahharders29@gmail.com. Your questions, suggestions, or collaborations are welcome, as this repository aims to foster an open and collaborative environment for advancing the understanding of TMS and speech therapy.

We encourage researchers, developers, and practitioners interested in TMS and speech therapy to explore this repository and leverage the code to contribute to the ongoing research efforts in this field.

Note: This repository does not contain any personal or sensitive information. It solely focuses on code and data analysis related to the investigation of TMS treatment in combination with speech therapy.
